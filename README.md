ROLE OF SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS -  
Social Network Analysis (SNA) plays a crucial role in cyberthreat detection by examining relationships and interactions within digital environments. Cyberthreats often emerge from interconnected entities, such as hackers, insider threats, or bots, which SNA helps to identify and analyze. By constructing networks of these entities and mapping their interactions, SNA uncovers hidden patterns and insights crucial for detecting and mitigating threats. It identifies key players or nodes, such as influential hackers or compromised accounts, that act as central hubs in spreading attacks. Furthermore, SNA enables the analysis of threat propagation by visualizing how malware, phishing attempts, or disinformation flow through a network. Through the detection of anomalies, such as deviations from normal communication or behavior, SNA can flag suspicious activities indicative of cyber risks.

METHODOLOGY -  The methodology begins with data collection from sources like server logs, social media, or communication platforms to map interactions. This data is used to construct a graph with nodes (entities) and edges (relationships). Network metrics, such as centrality and clustering coefficients, help quantify these relationships, identifying key actors or influential nodes. Community detection algorithms like Louvain or Girvan-Newman group entities into clusters, highlighting suspicious collaborations. AI-based anomaly detection further identifies unusual patterns, such as a sudden increase in activity or unexpected connections. The resulting network is visualized using tools like Gephi or Cytoscape, providing actionable insights for cybersecurity teams. Lastly, integrating SNA insights with external threat intelligence enriches the analysis and strengthens defense mechanisms.

By combining SNA with AI and data analytics, organizations gain a robust approach to understanding, predicting, and mitigating cyberthreats. This methodology enhances proactive threat detection, safeguards critical assets, and bolsters the overall resilience of cybersecurity systems.
